The `README.md` file is essential for documenting your project, and it typically includes information about the project’s purpose, installation, usage, and other important details. Here’s a basic template for what you can include in your `README.md` for your PHP project:

# SSRS - Full Stack PHP Application

## Project Description

SSRS (Server Side Rendered Solution) is a simple PHP-based web application that follows the MVC architecture pattern. It is designed to demonstrate a full-stack setup using PHP for the backend and MySQL for the database. The application includes user authentication, a routing system, and a basic front-end interface.

## Features
- MVC architecture (Model-View-Controller).
- User authentication system with login/logout functionality.
- Database connection and management.
- Front-end (HTML, CSS, and JS) for user interaction.

## Requirements
- PHP (version 7.x or higher)
- MySQL
- XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP or any local server stack that supports PHP and MySQL.
- Composer (if you're using any PHP dependencies).

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ssrs.git
```

### 2. Set up the Local Server
- Install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) (or use any other local PHP server stack).
- Place the project folder (`ssrs`) inside the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation. The path should be:

  ```plaintext
  C:\xampp\htdocs\ssrs
  ```

### 3. Configure the Database
- Open phpMyAdmin by going to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`.
- Create a new database and name it (e.g., `ssrs_db`).
- Import your database schema (if you have a `.sql` file), or manually create the required tables.
- Update the `config/database.php` file to match your local database credentials.

```php
<?php
return [
    'host' => 'localhost',
    'dbname' => 'your_database_name',
    'user' => 'root',
    'password' => '',
];
```

### 4. Start the Server
- Open the **XAMPP Control Panel**.
- Start **Apache** and **MySQL**.

### 5. Access the Application
- Open a web browser and go to:

  ```plaintext
  http://localhost/ssrs/public/
  ```

  This should bring up the home page of the app.

## Usage

- **Login/Logout**: Access the login page at `http://localhost/ssrs/public/auth/login.php` to log into the application. After successful login, users can logout via the logout button.
- **Routes**: The routes for the app are defined in the `routes/web.php` file.
